# Flutter's DevQuiz

## About

This is a project developed over the Flutter course from RocketSeat's next-level-week-05. I made some small improvements to the app, but almost everything from the original Figma was followed. 

The App is a quiz application. It has a home screen with your user profile and progress and a quiz list, also when you click any quiz, you start it, and at the end there a possibility to share your performance with your friends. 
It's pretty simple, but I was able work on some state management approaches, design system concepts, animated widgets, and "fake-backend" (mocked) data fetching.
To improve it, I changed the mocked data fetching to Firestore Database fetching, but the old code can be accessed in older versions of the project. Also, the concept of `named routes` has been added.
